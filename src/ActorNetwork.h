 * This software is part of the NSF ITR Robot-PFC Working Memory Toolkit.
 *
 * This class holds all of the details of the actor network which may or may
 * not be used by the working memory system. It will slow learning to use this
 * system, but results in faster performance once the system is trained-up.
